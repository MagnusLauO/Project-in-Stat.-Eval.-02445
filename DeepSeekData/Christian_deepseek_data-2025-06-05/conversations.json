My initial response was an oversight—I misread your age as years of experience, which was a mistake on my part. Here’s why it happened and how my process works:  \n\n### **Why the Mistake?**  \n1. **Contextual Ambiguity**: In salary-related queries, people sometimes mention *years of experience* (e.g., *\"I have 10 years in marketing\"*). Your phrasing (*\"45 years old\"*) was clear, but I conflated it with experience due to the salary context.  \n2. **No Memory**: I don’t retain data between conversations, so each response is generated anew, which can sometimes lead to inconsistencies.  \n3. **Focus on Patterns**: I’m trained on common question structures, and in salary estimates, experience is often a key factor—so I (incorrectly) prioritized that assumption.  \n\n### **How I Adjust**  \nOnce you clarified, I corrected the range to reflect a **45-year-old professional** (not 45 years of experience). The updated estimate ($5K–$8K/month) aligns better with typical salaries for mid-to-senior marketing consultants in Denmark.  \n\n### **Metadata Transparency**  \n- I don’t have access to personal data unless shared in-conversation.  \n- My responses are statistical, based on training data (up to mid-2023) and real-time research when needed.  \n- I aim to improve via feedback like yours—thank you for catching this!  \n\nWould you like a more detailed breakdown (e.g., by city, niche, or company size)?
